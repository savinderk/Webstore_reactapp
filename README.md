# reactproject

Using the "template folder" tutorial, [built a simple project template using Node/npm, Webpack, Babel and React JS](https://www.notion.so/Configure-Webpack-and-Babel-to-build-a-React-application-d6243f667ccc4d37a32a604a151b406d). Rebuild the static HTML/CSS webstore layout, using React Components, driven by an Array of product data

This project may use any number of React Components, but at minimum, This project will have:

- `App`: Will hold the entire layout, including the header, footer, etc. App will also be where the data for this application will be stored as an array.
- `ProductList`: A component that when given an array of product objects, will map each object to a product
- `Product`: Will receive an object of data from the ProductList, and will populate the Product using the data provided, based on the HTML view for a product, developed in Part 1

This deliverable does not need to include any functional code beyond the mapping of data (stored in `App`) down to the views (built in `Product`).

Assessment will be primarily focused on the naming and structure of components, variables, imports, data structures, general code cleanliness and best practices. The project should compile and run without errors (both for console and terminal).
